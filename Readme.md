Web Scraper Readme
Overview
This Python script performs web scraping to search for a specified keyword using Google and extracts the URLs from the search results. It employs the requests library to fetch the search results page and BeautifulSoup from the bs4 library to parse the HTML content.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You also need to install the required libraries. You can install the libraries using pip:

bash

pip install requests beautifulsoup4
Usage
Run the script: Execute the script in your command line or terminal.

bash

python script_name.py
Input the keyword: When prompted, enter the keyword you wish to search for in Google.

View the results: The script will output the URLs of the search results associated with that keyword.

Code Explanation
The script enters an infinite loop that continuously prompts the user for a keyword.
It constructs a Google search URL using the keyword provided by the user.
It sends an HTTP GET request to the constructed URL.
It uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content of the response.
It finds all anchor (<a>) tags in the HTML to extract URLs.
For each link found, it checks if the URL starts with /url?q=, indicating it's a search result link, and extracts the actual URL using a regular expression.
Finally, it prints out the extracted URLs to the console.
Important Notes
Google's Terms of Service: Be aware that scraping Google's search results may violate their Terms of Service. Use this code responsibly and ensure you comply with their policies.
Rate Limiting: Google may block requests if it detects that the scraping activities are too frequent. It is advisable to implement a delay between requests or run the code with appropriate rate limits.
Infinite Loop: The script runs indefinitely; you may need to terminate it manually when you are done searching.
Example
Here's an example of how it appears when running the script:

text

Enter the keyword you want to search for: web scraping
https://www.example1.com
https://www.example2.com
https://www.example3.com
Conclusion
This script is a simple demonstration of how to use Python for scraping web pages and extracting useful information. Depending on your needs, you can modify and extend this functionality further.
